        <h1>Data about Shelter Dogs in France (2026)</h1>

        <p>Now that we have some data about shelter dogs in France, we can ask ourselves about why does these dogs are in shelters.</p>

        <p>Let's first evaluate which dog breeds are the most represented in shelters.</p>
        <img src="plots/top20_breeds.png" alt="Top 20 breeds chart">

        <h2>How to explain this data? Are these dogs particularly unfriendly?</h2>
        <img src="plots/affectionate_top20.png" alt="Top 20 breeds affectionate">

        <p>We can see that the top 20 most represented dog breeds have a majority of index 5 over 5 for the "Affectionate with family" index. Our hypothesis do not follow the characteristics of the most represented dogs in shelters.</p>

        <h2>Let's find a new hypothesis : are these dogs difficult to train?</h2>
        <img src="plots/easy_to_train_hist.png" alt="Easy to train">

        <p>The majority of the dogs in shelter have an "Easy to train" index of 5 over 5, we cannot draw conclusions about training abilities. </p>

        <h2>Unfortunately, the main reason may be the size...</h2>
        <img src="plots/size_hist.png" alt="Size">

        <p>Indeed, a large majority of shelter dogs have very large or large size. We can make the assumption that this is a recurrent excuse for abandoning dogs.</p>

        <h2>What if we estimate which breeds are the most adopted?</h2>

        <img src="plots/top20_breeds_adopted.png" alt="adopted">

        <p>We can see that the most adopted breeds are the same as the most abandoned. Mainly because they are overrepresented in the shelters. This result may reflect a cycle of adoption and re-abandonment, potentially linked to a lack of information about breed-specific needs, which is precisely what our dataset aims to address.</p>
